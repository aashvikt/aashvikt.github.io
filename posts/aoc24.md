# Advent of Code 2024
![aoc calendar](./calendar.avif)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) is an annual advent calendar of programming challenges from Eric Wastl, running from December 1^st^ to 25^th^ each year since 2015.

Even though I'd tried some of the earlier year's days before, this year was my first time doing the challenges real-time during the event. This year, I did all but 4 of the 50 parts, and so couldn't finish Day 25's chronicle.

I competed on the [veloren](https://gitlab.com/veloren/dev/veloren) leaderboard and came third:

I solved AoC in python, and you can view my solutions on the [github repo](https://github.com/aashvikt/aoc24). I've not uploaded all of them yet, as I'm going to clean each of them up.

It was enjoyable!
