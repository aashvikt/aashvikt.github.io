# I built a computer
I [built](https://youtu.be/YVjWz2rc13A) my first PC. It's pretty easy to do this, like lego with heavy metal parts and only a few combinations.

I optimized my parts list for price:

Type        | Part
------------|-----------------------------------|
Processor   | AMD Ryzen 5 3400G                 |
RAM         | Corsair 8GB Single                |
Motherboard | ASUS Expedition A320M G           |
UPS         | APC Back-UPS 600C                 |
SSD         | Crucial BX500 256GB               |
Case        | Ant Esports ICE-200TG Mid-Tower   |

It's around $300.

Assembly was a tad scary. I/O covers are sharper than front panel pins and other connectors. I bled.

The specs are decent for me, as 8GB RAM is enough on Linux and Vega 11 is the fastest APU. I dualboot Windows and Manjaro, they mainly run Blender and Godot.
