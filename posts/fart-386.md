# LM386 "Opinionated" Synth
![breadboard circuit with analog components](~/board.avif)

I've been messing around with analog audio circuits a bunch recently, making a few breadboard guitar amplifiers with components I had on hand, an adventure experimentally fun and quite easy due to the abundance of diagrams and datasheets online.

One recurring component of these amps and active pedals is the well-known LM386 audio amplifier IC, some clones (of "KM386" variety) of which I had on hand. One thing led to another, and, messing with resistance and capacitance values with potentiometers and a breadboard, I somehow made myself a fully analog battery-powered flatulence synthesizer!

Some gassy, organic tones weren't long to be dialed in. Here's some squeals I recorded, with a particularly diarrheic part edited out:

Go on, let one rip.
